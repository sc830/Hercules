### Summary ###
This project was a collaborative effort with a small software development team and was an amazing learning experience. I gained proficiency in many new technologies, including React Native, Google Cloud, Firebase, and Firestore. I learned a lot about working with a team, including how to plan our sprints, divide work effectively for simultaneous progress, and utilizing sprint retrospectives to improve our plan for the next sprint. Over the course of the project, our teamwork improved dramatically, as well as our efficiency, time management, and our product.
